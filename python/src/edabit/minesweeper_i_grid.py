Minesweeper I â€” Grid
This challenge is based on the game Minesweeper.

Create a function that takes a grid of # and -, where each hash (#) represents
a mine and each dash (-) represents a mine-free spot. Return an array where each
dash is replaced by a digit indicating the number of mines immediately adjacent
to the spot (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally).
